# Conditional Types in Typescript

This is gonna implement ternary logic within the type definition
in typescript

## Importing Libraries

```
import fetch from "node-fetch";

interface PokemonResults {
  count: number;
  next?: string;
  previous?: string;
  results: {
    name: string;
    url: string;
  }[];
}
```

first, you have to install the node-fetch:

```
> npm i node-fetch
```

if you have an error that says:
couldn't find the declaration file for "node-fetch"

```
> npm i @types/node-fetch
```
