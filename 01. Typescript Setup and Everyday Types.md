# Typescript Setup and Everyday Types

## Why Typescript?

1. Save your bacon

- call null value
- call function without right params
- don't know the fields or put wrong fields

2. Help you code faster!

- you'll know what the right fields are right away
- know if you're missing fields right away

## Start Coding

example in basics.js:

```
let username = "Yehezkel";
let hasLoggedIn = true;

hasLoggedIn += " Herrington";

console.log(hasLoggedIn);
```

#### note:

the operation is not right and doesn't have any real meaning

## Typescript Setup

in your terminal:

```
> yarn init -y
> npm i typescript -D
> npm i ts-node -D
> npx tsc --init
> npx ts-node jsfile.js
```

#### note:

<code>npm i typescript -D</code> --> this is gonna install the typescript compiler
<code>-D</code> --> this means that it's gonna be installed in development mode
<br>
<code>ts-node</code> --> this is a wrapper around node that works for typescript files
<br>
<code>npx tsc --init</code> --> this is gonna initialize typescript configuration file.
first, it's gonna throw an error because there're no .ts file
<br>
<code>npx ts-node jsfile.js</code> --> use ts-node to our javascript. if this returns the same output as if we use the javascript compiler, then it's working
<br><br>
You can define a typescript file by adding the extension as .ts

## Specifying Types

you can just press "ctrl + k, ctrl + i" to show the type, then copy add the <code>: \[type\]</code>

```
let username: string = "Yehezkel";
let hasLoggedIn: boolean = true;
```

#### note:

This is how you specify the type for a value in typescript
<br><br>
full code in basics.ts:

```
let username: string = "Yehezkel";
let hasLoggedIn: boolean = true;

username += " Wiradhika";

console.log(username);

let myNumber: number = 10;

let regex: RegExp = /foo/;
```

## Typing Arrays

```
const names: string[] = username.split(" ");
```

another way of telling an array: generic type

```
const myValues: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
```

if you wanna return an array that have different data types, you can use a mechanism called tuple

## Typing Objects

```
const myPerson: {
  first: string;
  last: string;
} = {
  first: "Yehezkel",
  last: "Wiradhika",
};
```

define the constraint once so that you can reuse it:

```
interface Person {
  first: string;
  last: string;
}

const myPerson: Person = {
  first: "Yehezkel",
  last: "Wiradhika",
};
```

This is also gonna allow you to do great hinting for example after the above code and we do this:
<code>myPerson.</code> then it'll automatically show the fields that are available to you based on the interface

## Records

Using objects as maps in javascript
<br>
if you wanna do something like this:

```
const ids = {
  10: "a",
  20: "b",
};
ids[30] = "c";
```

This is gonna return an error. how do you make this possible (to not return an error)?
<br>
you're gonna have to use a utility
type that is called <code>Record</code>

```
const ids: Record<number, string> = {
  10: "a",
  20: "b",
};
ids[30] = "c";
```

## Conditionals and Expressions

if you do something like this:

```
if (ids[30] == 2) {
}
```

This isn't gonna work because you're comparing different datatypes

## Loops

if you do something like this:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

i is inferred to be a number.
you don't really have to specify the i. you can, but you really should let typescript infer as much as possible
<br><br>
another example:

```
[1, 2, 3].forEach(v => console.log(v);
const out = [4, 5, 6].map(v => v * 10)
```

the out is gonna be able to know that if we map an array of number, then it's gonna return an array of number. meaning out will have the type of <code>: number[]</code>
